description:  Random Thoughts on Youtubers.
---

Have you ever wondered how some youtubers that you think are boring have so many subscribers? Well that is true because that is what a lot of people like these days. Young kids think it is fun because that is what their minds are like. They are attracted to these types of genres, like video games and destruction. Some who are factual like videos about maybe space or coding or DIY builds. It usually depends on what that person likes. 

Some youtubers capture most of the things kids like, like MrBeast. He almost captures all the genres kids enjoy. He has videos of gameplay, donations, survival, and probably more. Also sometimes you can talk about how your life is. I am a big fan of TheOdd1sOut. It talks about a kid talking about his life. It is very interesting because I really like how he talks all about his life and the events that happened in it. It really makes me laugh when he talks about the funny events. That is something very good that youtubers do. Sometimes, it also depends on the games they play. If they play a popular game, then they probably would get a lot of subscribers. They also need to be good at the game, that is really important. If you aren’t good at the game. People would think it is a waste of time and would probably even dislike the video. So it really depends on their skill and experience. 

Well that is really how they get subscribers. If the youtuber you think is boring and has a lot of subscribers that don’t follow the steps, then they must have some different ideas. If you look at MarkRober, he kind of falls in the DIY section or coding section. Also Dream and Technoblade, they all fall in the gaming section. They all play Minecraft and are really good at it. That is also why they get a lot of subscribers. Now you know how youtubers get subscribers you can start your own! You can talk about anything in this list and you can probably become a great youtuber!
