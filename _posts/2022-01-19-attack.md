Browsing websites is easy. But when you are in the middle of a search, you get interrupted by a screen that is asking you the easiest question. You sigh and continue. 

Usually people don’t put it on their mind and usually don’t care. But have you ever wondered why it’s there? Well that is what prevents DDOS attacks. 

DDOS attacks are really annoying for other people. It jams other people's devices and basically breaks the website. It's like a narrow road with too many cars or vehicles. 

This is why we have reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is a system that asks you to complete a set of simple questions. This is used to block bots so that it can block DDOS attacks. 

reCAPTCHA is sometimes really helpful but not really efficient. Let's say you are on your way to an urgent meeting and you are really stressed out because you are almost late. But then reCAPTCHA comes out of nowhere. Because of your stress you didn’t do it correctly. So then you got banned. After that, your boss fired you and now you are broke. 

In the future, reCAPTCHA should update its system and be able to block hackers and also be a lot more efficient.
