Random fact of the week :smile: In the United States and Canada a period is used (see Abbreviation). Mrs originated as a contraction of the honorific Mistress, the feminine of Mister, or Master, which was originally applied to both married and unmarried women. The split into Mrs for married women from Ms and Miss began during the 17th century.
